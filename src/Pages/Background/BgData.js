    description:'"Welcome to our Camino De Santiago planning website! Our passion is encouraging people to experience the life changing Camino de Santiago! Our aim with this website is to provide an English language website that has all the information you need to plan your pilgrimage. Initially, we are focusing on the Camino Francés as it is the most walked pilgrim route to Santiago. We do, however, have plans to expand to include the Camino Portuguese, the Camino del Norte and the Camino Inglés. We plan to fund the website through advertising and a small amount of affiliate links. We plan to supplement this with a small paid subscription which will remove all adverts. Irrespective of whether you use this website, or any other, we strongly encourage you to take your first steps on the Way of Saint James and wish you ¡Buen Camino!"',
